0x00. AirBnB clone - The console group project

# This project will entail:

- Putting in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
- Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- Creating all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

#How to use it:

- Start up the console by typing ./console.
- Type help to see what commands are available.
